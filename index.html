            <p>I’ve always got music playing while I work—it’s my secret fuel for staying motivated. So, when I was hunting for the perfect domain name for my website, scrolling through Google like a detective on a case, naturally, my playlist was on. My playlist was pumping when suddenly, Takeaway by The Chainsmokers song kicked in, and I was totally vibing. Suddenly, I had a lightbulb moment! The line “your heart for takeaway” stuck with me, and then it hit me—my portfolio is basically my resume for takeaway! Why not call it resume4takeaway? And just like that—boom! Inspiration struck. That’s the story behind my quirky domain name, straight from my playlist to the web!</p>
